            <h2>What is Cloud Provisioning?</h2>
            <p class="justified">Cloud provisioning involves creating, preparing, and activating the underlying infrastructure of a cloud environment. It can include installing networking components and services. Provisioning entails setting up resources, services, and applications inside your cloud after youâ€™ve built the basic infrastructure.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "types-of-provisioning">
        <h2 class="h2-size">Types of Provisioning</h2>
        <p>There are three types of provisioning in cloud computing with varying degrees of flexibility, control, and pricing structure. It includes:</p>
        <ol class="bold-list">
            <li>Manual Provisioning</li>
            <p class="justified">In manual provisioning, resources are allocated and configured manually by administrators or users through a management console or API. This method requires direct intervention for each resource provisioning task and is suitable for environments with low resource turnover or where fine-grained control is necessary.</p>
            <li>Self-Service Provisioning</li>
            <p class="justified">Self-service provisioning allows users to provision resources themselves without involving administrators. Users typically access a self-service portal or interface where they can select and provision the resources they need, such as virtual machines, storage volumes, or databases. This approach improves agility and reduces dependency on IT staff for resource provisioning.</p>
            <li>Automatic Provisioning</li>
            <p class="justified">Policy-based provisioning involves defining rules or policies that govern resource allocation and configuration based on specific criteria or conditions. These policies may consider factors such as workload characteristics, performance requirements, compliance regulations, or cost constraints. Automated systems then enforce these policies to provision and manage resources accordingly, ensuring alignment with business objectives and regulatory requirements.</p>

            <li>Template-Based Provisioning</li>
            <p class="justified">Template-based provisioning involves creating predefined templates or blueprints that encapsulate resource configurations, dependencies, and best practices. Users can then instantiate these templates to provision resources quickly and consistently, eliminating the need for manual configuration. Templates may include configurations for virtual machines, networks, security settings, and application components, streamlining the provisioning process and promoting standardization.</p>
